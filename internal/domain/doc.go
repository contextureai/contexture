//
// This package implements Domain-Driven Design principles and contains:
//   - Core domain entities (Rule, Project)
//   - Value objects for type safety and validation
//   - Domain interfaces for format operations
//   - Business constants and configuration
//
// The domain package is independent of infrastructure concerns and defines
