# Documentation Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

This document provides guidelines for writing technical documentation for this project. The goal is to ensure that all documentation is consistent, clear, accurate, and useful for its intended audience.

These guidelines apply to all technical documentation, whether written by human contributors or generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 2. Target Audience

The primary audience for our technical documentation is **experienced software engineers**.

Assume the reader:
- Is familiar with Go, CLI tools, and general software architecture concepts (e.g., dependency injection, interfaces, repository patterns).
- Wants to get up to speed with our project quickly.
- Can understand technical details without extensive explanations of fundamental concepts.

The documentation should be a technical reference, not a tutorial for beginners.

## 3. Tone of Voice

The tone of our documentation should be:

- **Technical and Direct**: Use precise, unambiguous language. Use technical terms accurately. Get straight to the point.
- **Formal and Professional**: Avoid overly casual language, slang, humor, or personal opinions.
- **Concise**: Eliminate verbose language, marketing fluff, and repetition.
- **Objective**: Present factual information. Avoid subjective or opinionated statements.

## 4. Content and Structure

This section provides guidelines for the structure of package `README.md` files.

### Package `README.md` Files

Each package's `README.md` file should provide a technical overview of that package.

- **Title**: The title should be the package name (e.g., `# My Package`).
- **Summary**: The first paragraph should be a single sentence that concisely explains the package's purpose.
- **Features / Purpose**: A section with a bulleted list detailing the key features or responsibilities of the package.
- **Architecture / Design**: An explanation of the high-level design and architecture of the package. Use Mermaid diagrams to illustrate concepts where appropriate.
- **Usage**: A brief section explaining how the package is used by other parts of the project.
- **API**: A section detailing the main public API of the package, including key functions and interfaces.

### Diagrams

- Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams to illustrate architecture, flows, and relationships.
- Diagrams should be clear, easy to understand, and accompanied by explanatory text if necessary.
- When rewriting documentation, do not change existing Mermaid diagrams unless instructed to do so.

## 5. Writing Style

- **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    - Use short, simple sentences.
    - Use the active voice.
    - Avoid jargon where a simpler term will suffice.
- **Code**:
    - Use backticks (`) for inline code, such as function names (`MyFunction()`), package names (`my_package`), filenames (`README.md`), and type names.
    - Use triple-backtick code blocks for multi-line code examples. Specify the language (e.g., `go`, `bash`, `yaml`).
- **Headings**: Use markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to create a clear structure. Use sentence case for headings.
- **Lists**: Use bulleted or numbered lists to break up text and improve readability.

## 6. Guidelines for LLMs

When using an LLM to generate or update documentation, use the following instructions in your prompt.

### Persona

> You are an expert technical writer creating documentation for an open-source software project. Your audience is experienced software engineers. Your tone is formal, direct, and technical.

### Instructions

- Adhere to all guidelines in this document (`docs/specs/documentation_guidelines.md`).
- When rewriting existing documentation, preserve the existing structure and all technical details.
- Do not change or remove existing Mermaid diagrams.
- Focus on improving conciseness and removing any marketing-oriented or "sales-y" language.
- Ensure all package names, function names, and other symbols are formatted as inline code.
