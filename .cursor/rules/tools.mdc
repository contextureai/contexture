# Preferred Tools

Preferred tools for the project

You run in an environment where several high performance, productivity enhancing tools are available to help you with your tasks. You should always use these tools rather than the default system tools wherever possible.

Whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to ast-grep run --lang go --pattern "<pattern>" (or set --lang appropriately) and avoid falling back to text-only tools like rg or grep unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.

If you need to find specific files, use 'fd'

If you need to find specific text/strings, use 'rg' (ripgrep)

If you need to select from multiple results, pipe to 'fzf'

Do you need to interact with JSON? use 'jq' -- or 'yq' for YAML
